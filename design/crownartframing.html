        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>
          The Project involves designing a minimalist aesthetic online shop or
          an ecommerce site mainly focusing on relevant arts that can placed on
          a wall.The projects stands out to engage their customers by
          accompaning a virtual wall planner wher users can test the art work in
          their spaces at the point of sale before purchasing.All other features
          of a well structured e-commerce website including products
          page,product-detail,cart and chaeckout page are in place.
        </p>

      <section id="section1">
        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>
          The main problem the project was trying to solve is to avoid doubt of
          how the wall arts will look at a given room space when customers are
          purchasing hence increasing sales for the business.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          by integrating a virtual wall planner into the e-commerce platform,
          customers will have a more interactive and engaging shopping
          experience, which will lead to increased customer satisfaction and
          higher conversion rates. This feature is anticipated to reduce the
          uncertainty of online art purchases by allowing users to visualize how
          products will look in their own space, ultimately driving sales and
          boosting overall revenue for the business.

          I sketched multiple user flows to visualize ideas quickly. My focus at
          this stage is to diverge first, converge later. Here are some early
          sketches of the Brand page.

          A sneak peek into my early wireframes, mid-fidelity designs and
          drafts. The designs have went through at least 10 iterations per
          screen. It is simply to improve the user experience.
